# FlexTable (Beta)
HTML5 table using Flexbox. 

## Why FlexTable?

FlexTable uses [FlexBox] (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#flexbox-background) to create modern & painless tables. Don't believe me? Try creating a table with locked headers and a scrollbar. It can be a major pain if you're using a library like AngularJS or React and the amount of headers is dynamic.
